README for Pots - Perl ObjectThreads

This module collection aims to provide an object-oriented way
of working with Perl ithreads.

Current features are:

- Inter-thread communication through messages and message-queues
- A simple "MethodServer" class that exposes a standard class to
  other threads. Method calls are automatically handled.
  (Kind of RPC for threads)

******
IMPORTANT NOTE:
You must have at least Perl 5.8.0 compiled with interpreter threads.
These modules have only been tested on Perl 5.8.3.
